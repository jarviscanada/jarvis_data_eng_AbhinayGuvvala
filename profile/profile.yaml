# Introduce yourself, your academic and professional background.
# What excites you about the software industry and your passion. At least 80 words
summary: I am a graduate who recently joined Jarvis as Software and Data Engineer. I am being given the opportunity to apply my knowledge and hone my skills with industry-standard tools such as Java, SQL, Bash, Docker, Git, and GCP. At Jarvis, I have worked as a team to develop efficient software solutions to complex real-world business problems following Agile/Scrum methodologies. I gained a great understanding and hands-on experience of the software development cycle. My broad educational background made me a quick learner and an analytical thinker. I spend my free time volunteering. While at Fanshawe, I tutor students better understand technical concepts. Being able to work in teams and making an impact in peopleâ€™s lives makes me excited about software development.

      - "Twitter App: Developed a command-line interface that allows users to send, get, and delete tweets from Twitter with a developer account. It uses MVC(Model-View-Controller) design pattern to manage the code structure. The Rest APIs interact with Twitter, Maven, and Spring as dependency managers, JUnit and Mockito for testing, and Docker for the deployment."
      - "JDBC App: Implemented CRUD and DML operations and tested on generated SQL sales data. Built using the Data Access Object (DAO) pattern. Made in Java with the Maven project management tool."
      - "Grep App: Deployed a Java application using docker that simulates the Unix grep implementation that searches all files recursively from a given directory argument and outputs a file containing all the lines that match the given regex pattern argument. The application utilizes Java 8 streams for memory efficiency and is managed using Maven."
