I am being given the opportunity to apply my knowledge and hone my skills with industry-standard tools such as Java, SQL, Bash, Docker, Git, and GCP. At Jarvis, I have worked as a team to develop efficient software solutions to complex real-world business problems following Agile/Scrum methodologies. I gained a great understanding and hands-on experience of the software development cycle. My broad educational background made me a quick learner and an analytical thinker. I spend my free time volunteering. While at Fanshawe, I tutor students better understand technical concepts. Being able to work in teams and making an impact in peopleâ€™s lives makes me excited about software development."
